# BluHoriseon
Horiseon Marketing


Project Details
This project is a part of the module 1 challenge, where the task is to refactor an existing website for a marketing agency. The client requires a codebase that follows accessibility standards to optimise SEO and improve accessibility for users.
Features
Improved accessibility for people with disabilities.
Enhanced codebase for sustainability.
Removed repetitive code.
Optimized CSS with consolidated selectors and properties.
Organised CSS following the semantic structure of HTML elements.
Added comments for clarity and documentation.



I removed the heart emoji from the footer because that can affect accessibility for those with visual impairment or those using a screen reader. It is advised that when using emojis one places them at the end of a sentence not in the middle or uses an Ariar label. Ref: Making your social media accessible | CharityComms
