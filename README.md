# BluHoriseon

Horiseon Marketing

## Project Details 
This project is a part of the module 1 challenge, where the task is to refactor an existing website for a marketing agency. The client requires a codebase that follows accessibility standards to optimise SEO and improve accessibility for users.


## Features

- Improved accessibility for people with disabilities. 
- Enhanced codebase for sustainability. 
- Removed repetitive code. 
- Optimised CSS with consolidated selectors and properties.
- Organised CSS following the semantic structure of HTML elements.
- Added comments for clarity and documentation.

# Other
I removed the heart emoji from the footer because that can affect accessibility for those with visual impairment or those using a screen reader. It is advised that when using emojis one places them at the end of a sentence not in the middle or uses an Ariar label.
